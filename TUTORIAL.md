(You can also skip it using `sys.migrate { confirm: true }` though the tutorial is fun!)

# Tips for the hackmud tutorial

To avoid making another user, use `trust.sentience {f1rST:"H41f", S3c0nd:"h@/_F"}`

`halperyon.helpdesk {password:"water", option:"helpdesk_roster", roster_pass: "doge"}` common mistake to put "dog" :). You can also put in other famous dogs too!

## abandoned_ldi221.info_6aiwqp

As mentioned in the `c00lest_kats` chat, this is an [`EZ_21`](./LOCKS.md) lock.

Once you're done with this, also crack `uknown_ih72qq.access_h59dn2` in `kernel.hardline` mode.

## uknown_ih72qq.access_h59dn2

You'll need to go into hardline mode (`kernel.hardline`)

In hardline mode, first retype the numbers on the top

Do note that this mode is just unlocking but on a time constraint.

Use this to crack `uknown_ih72qq.access_h59dn2`

## anon_anuw21.extern_94a5b3

This lock is locked with an [`EZ_35`](./LOCKS.md) lock.

Once you unlock this lock, a new chat action will open, where you use all the keys on the helpdesk script.

For example: `halperyon.helpdesk {a3z: "cradle", c0o: "grave", wzj: 2}`

## betrayal

send nothing. I haven't found a way out of this (yet).

## the trust fund

Once you talk to faythe in `faythes_fountain` (who loves speaking in HTTP status codes!), you'll be granted with che's mom's (petra) trust fund:

Once you read through the letters, they have a certain CAPITAL NUMBER pattern to them that you can use to form a doc disposal command:

<details>
  <summary>Petra's mail office <code>doc_disposal</code></summary>
  
`petra.office_mailroom_3fotu1 { activity:"doc_disposal", option:"retrieve", force: true, checksum: 2410 }`
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>helperbot's gift</summary>
  
  `petra.office_mailroom_3fotu1 { activity: "notary", item:"corgi"}` give that little cute helperbot what it deserves!

## breaking the mallory propaganda

Unfortunately for us, the access level of this propaganda script is [`MIDSEC`](./SECURITY_LEVEL.md) which

```
>>/level yrollam.join_me_kitties
scripts.get_level { name: "yrollam.join_me_kitties" }
MIDSEC
```

(see [macros](./MACROS.md) to run that fancy `/level` macro)

means that this script may be getting our hard-earned money. We have no choice but to run it.

run it again, raise hell, and join them!

## money laundring

steal some GC from the money laundring script to get enough to run `sys.init` (1MGC) and begin browsing the market!

## revenge?

break into yrollam's script, and make a choice. Regardless of who you pick, you will be working for both.

TIP: get me the system which got access after "some user" got access after is in REVERSE order:

```

```

Once you finish the first firewall, remember that other user you created? In vLAN, you can jump about the tutorial -- use that to your advantage and join the angels or the minions -- whichever one you missed.

Or, if you're lazy:
